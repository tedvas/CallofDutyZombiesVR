# Call of Duty Zombies VR

Everything in this like the maps were initialy developed by Treyarch and Activision, I'm simply porting it to VR using Unreal Engine 5

In order to install and run or edit the engine version you will need to

+ install Epic Games Launcher - https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download?install=true
+ install Unreal Engine 5.0
+ install Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&cid=2030&passive=false
+ in the root folder right click the .uproject file and click generate project files (on windows 11 you might need to click show more options)
+ open the .sln file and set the configuration to development editor and the platform to Win64
+ compile the code (this might take a while)
+ open the .uproject file
